##INTRODUCTION

VbGen is a waveform simulation tool based on "Applied ECM: Vol. 2" by Leroy 
B. Van Brunt. This repo includes a PDF scan of the relevant sections in 
the book.  

The tool generates In-Phase / Quadrature-Phase (I/Q) data in the form of
output files, encapsulating noise jamming waveforms of various classes
(see Figure 152). Various Radio Frequency (RF) instrumentation, in the
form of Software-Defined Radios (SDR) or Arbitrary Waveform 
Generators (AWG), may read such output files to generate electronic
waveforms at RF.
